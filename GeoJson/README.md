* This folder contains the boundaries for every district used by every state.  

* In the previous version, these files were lower resolution than those contained in the district-by-district shape files found at https://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/.  Now they are full resolution (i.e., the same as those in the shape files).  

* The numbers following the state names are congresses (for example, the 17th Congress, which met from 1821 to 1823), giving the range of congresses for which the boundaries are active.  Generally, one range of congresses ends, and another begins when there is a redistricting.  However, sometimes a new range begins when there is a substantial change in the underlying geographies used to construct the districts (changes in the Tigerlines for the same features, for example).  In those cases, the legal definition of the districts may not have changed.
